# minimum-minify

A minimum implementation of using jspm solely for generating and bundling a dependency tree of global modules.

## installation

```bash
npm install  
npm run bundle  
serve .
```

## Notes:

- creates a [self-executing bundle](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/wiki/Production-Workflows#creating-a-self-executing-bundle)
- orders dependencies
- minification (with sourcemaps)


## TODO

- demo `jspm install angular` or other external dependency
